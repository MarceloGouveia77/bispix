Colin McRae Rally is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters for PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color. It is the first game in the Colin McRae Rally series. It features 8 official cars (and their drivers) and rallies from the 1998 World Rally Championship season, in addition to 4 extra cars.[2]

Colin McRae Rally is a rally simulation game, featuring the works-entered cars and the rallies of the 1998 WRC season. There are three difficulty modes in the game, and each mode offers different cars: the Novice mode offers FWD F2-class cars, such as the SEAT Ibiza F2 Kit Car, the Intermediate mode offers 4WD World Rally Car class cars, such as the Subaru Impreza WRC, and the Expert mode offers the ability to unlock bonus cars, such as Ford Escort MKII, Lancia Delta Integrale, Audi Quattro S1, and Ford RS200. There are a total of 12 cars, produced using laser-modelling.[2]

Seven official rallies (New Zealand, Acropolis (Greece), Australia, Monte Carlo Sweden, Corsica, and the United Kingdom), and one unofficial rally (Indonesia) from the WRC were included in the game.[2] Rally Indonesia was originally part of the 1998 WRC season calendar, but the rally was cancelled due to civil unrest.[3] Although the rallies themselves are named the same as the real events, all of the stages are fictional.[4]

Although there is no internet-based multiplayer, the game does feature LAN-based multiplayer, allowing up to 8 drivers, on the same network, to compete at once, in addition to a 2-player split-screen mode.[2] Sales soared, and the sequel Colin McRae Rally 2.0 was released on 14 December 2000.
