Catlateral Damage is a first person video game in which the player plays as a cat. The only goal of the game is to knock as many of your owner's belongings onto the floor as possible.[1] There are game modes in which the player can either race against the clock and get a certain number of items onto the floor as fast as they can, score as many points in a 2-minute time-frame, or a free play mode where there is no clock and there are no points.

The original version of Catlateral Damage was created for the August 2013 7DFPS game jam.[2][3] Development for a full release began in September 2013.[2]

On 13 January 2014, Catlateral Damage was released on Steam's "Steam Greenlight" service.[4] There was a Kickstarter campaign for the game that ran between 16 June 2014 and 11 July 2014.[5]

The full version of the game was released on Steam on 27 May 2015.[6]
