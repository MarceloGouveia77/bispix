Motorsport Manager is a management simulation game developed by Playsport Games. The game was released on iOS in August 2014 and Android in 2015. The game was published by Sega on macOS and Windows and released in November 2016.

The iOS version of Motorsport Manager received positive reviews from critics.[4]

J. D. Cohen of TouchArcade awarded the game a score of 4.5 out of 5, writing: "It’s never overwhelming, nor is it too light to maintain interest. Motorsport Manager finds a nice spot in the complexity spectrum wherein it requires frequent decision-making, without ever inducing paralysis by presenting too many options simultaneously."[9]

Pocket Gamer's Harry Slater writes: "This is the ice cold nature of Motorsport Manager. One second you can be flying high in first place, the next your tyres fail you and you slip back to fifth, cursing as you do. (...) Things do get a little repetitive, but there's a huge game to work your way through here, and if it gets its claws into you it's unlikely to let go for a good long while. Motorsport Manager manages to walk the line between number-juggling sims and the softer end of the spectrum, and in doing so creates a strategy game that almost anyone can have a crack at." The website awarded a score of 9/10.[8]

The game sold over 1.6 million copies on mobile device.[10]
