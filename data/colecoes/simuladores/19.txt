Black & White is a god video game developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows in 2001. The game was published by Feral Interactive in 2002 for Mac OS. Black & White combines elements of artificial life, strategy, and fighting games. The player acts as a god and takes control over villages. The goal is to defeat Nemesis, a god wanting to destroy all others and take over the world. A primary theme is the concept of good and evil, and the atmosphere is determined by the player's behaviour. Black & White features a unique element: a creature who acts as the player's servant, and whose personality is shaped by its interaction with him. Multiplayer is supported over a local network or online.

Peter Molyneux led the three-year development of the highly anticipated game, originally to feature wizards instead of gods. Black & White was written from scratch using a great deal of custom software, and the intention was to have the main user interface free of icons, buttons, and panels. Versions for games consoles were in development, but cancelled.

Black & White received universal acclaim: reviewers praised the artificial intelligence, uniqueness, and depth, although the system requirements and bugs were criticised. The creatures' artificial intelligence set a Guinness World Record for its complexity. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, and sold over two million copies. Some reviewers re-reviewed the game and considered it over-rated. An expansion, Black & White: Creature Isle, and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.
