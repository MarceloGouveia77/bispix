World of Tanks is a massively multiplayer online game developed by the Belarusian-Cypriot[5] company Wargaming, featuring early to mid-20th century era combat vehicles.[6] It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is free-to-play, but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of "premium" features. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle, which may be a light, medium or heavy tank, tank destroyer, or self-propelled gun. World of Tanks debuted as an eSports game at the World Cyber Games 2012.[7]

World of Tanks has been ported to multiple gaming consoles. An Xbox 360 version was developed by Wargaming West studio, called World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition.[8][9][10][11] Xbox 360 players use separate servers to those playing the Windows version, and players of each version have separate accounts.[12] The PlayStation 4 version was released in 2016.[13] World of Tanks has also recently expanded to mobile platforms under the name World of Tanks Blitz, in addition to a board game titled World of Tanks Rush and a collectable card game titled World of Tanks: Generals.

The player takes control of a single armored vehicle of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle's movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team's base. There are other game modes that change the rules of the battle, but gameplay mechanics remain the same. World of Tanks contains multiple game mechanics such as camouflage, shell ricochets, and module damage.
