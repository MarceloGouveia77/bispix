Bus Driver is a game developed by SCS Software. The game was released digitally, for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 2007, and for OS X on 8 June 2011. A port to iOS, entitled Bus Driver - Pocket Edition, was released to the App Store by Meridian4 on 27 February 2014.

The player selects a route from tiers (described below), and then after a short loading time, the player sees the selected bus either at a bus depot or terminal. After halting at the first stop, the bus must be driven along the correct route (indicated at intersections by orange arrows) whilst obeying all traffic rules and stopping at all bus stops. If the player fails to do so, points will be taken from their score. When the game begins, one tier of routes, which includes six buses, is available. In total, there are six tiers, thirty-six routes and thirteen buses (seventeen in Temsa Edition). In order to unlock the next tier, the player must drive at least four of the routes successfully. As the game progresses, routes become more tedious. The player will lose points if they disobey traffic laws, upset passengers (by braking too hard or causing accidents) or they depart from the bus stop too early, or even if they leave passengers waiting at a bus stop. Conversely, the player will gain points for obeying traffic laws and being punctual.[1]

Despite being a game set in the United States, many of the bus stop names are named after areas of London, including Debden, Collier Row, Feltham, Potters Bar and the terminus Westminster.
